#Julia for Data Science
This is the code repository for [Julia for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/julia-data-science?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785289699), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
ci(x::HypothesisTests.FisherExactTest)
ci(x::HypothesisTests.FisherExactTest, alpha::Float64)
ci(x::HypothesisTests.TTest)
ci(x::HypothesisTests.TTest, alpha::Float64)
```

The reader will requires a system (64-bit recommended) having a fairly recent operating system (Linux, Windows 7+, and Mac OS) with a working Internet connection and privileges to install Julia, Git and various packages used in the book.
